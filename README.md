# 🎙️ Podcast Digest

Weekly insights from the best podcasts, distilled into digestible nuggets.

## What is this?

This is an automated archive of podcast digests generated by Claude. Each digest contains:

- **Deep Dives**: Full-length episodes with 10-12 categorized insights
- **Quick Hits**: Shorter clips with single key takeaways

## How it works

1. **Daily fetch**: GitHub Actions runs at 8am UTC to fetch new episodes from subscribed YouTube channels
2. **Auto-process**: Transcripts are processed into chunks for efficient analysis
3. **On-demand digest**: When triggered, Claude generates insights from the chunks
4. **Auto-publish**: Everything is committed to this repo and served via GitHub Pages

### 🚀 Fully Automated via GitHub Actions

No local machine required! See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for configuration instructions.
